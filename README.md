## Written reflection:

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
Andrew and I got on a call together and read through the entirety of iteration 3. We then looked at the Functionality Checklist and decided to use it as a sort of iteraction pattern. We discussed loosely what we thought our classes would be versus what methods we would have to create. We also took some time away to research and sit with iteration 3 so we could come back to our next meeting with ideas. But once we actually got into  writing iteration 3 our process was very dynamic and we were trying a lot of things, re-writing code, and going back to iteration 3 to make sure we had everything checked off. 


2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
We discussed going through the entire project and refractoring our code, cleaning it up, and making it look more organized. If we had more time we would also go through the project and look for places we could write added protection for our code to prevent any "breaking" attempts. We would also like to go back and re-do the computer random placement method. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
We mainly used the Driver / Navigator pairing technique during this project. We also took time to work separartley by dividing and conquering certain parts of the project. 

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
We went back to our DTR and looked over the questions and used it as an opportunity to give each other retrospective feedback. But we both were very good at providing feedback in real time when we were coding together. It mostly was supportive and appreciative feedback but we both were very good about asking questions about each other's code, checking in with each other, and overall communicating what was happening for us in the moment and what we felt we needed in order to be a better teammate. Working with each other felt very intuitive and felt like we were always on the same page.
